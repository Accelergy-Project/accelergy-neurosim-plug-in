# NeuroSim Accelergy Plugin
This Accelery plugin provides estimations for NeuroSim[1] components. It enables estimation for analog Processing-In-Memory Crossbar components and various peripheral components.

We also allow conversions for NVMExplorer[2]/NVSim[3] style cell files to Neurosim crossbars.

## PIM Crossbar Model
We encourage you read section 6 of the NeuroSim Manual in the DNN_NeuroSim_V1.3/Documents folder.

PIM crossbar energy/area is dominated by four pieces.

- Row Activation: This is the path for inputs to activate a crossbar. An input voltage will actiavte a wordline, or row of memory cells. Multiple input voltages or longer-duration inputs can feed higher resolution inputs.
- Column Activation: This is the path for outputs to be read out of a crossbar. Once input voltages have activated a wordline, they will feed current onto bitlines, or columns. Column activation is the energy required to get this current out and to precharge the wordline before reading.
- Cell: This a memory cells in the crossbar.
- Analog-Digital-Conversion: This is the circuit that reads an analog value from the crossbar and converts to a digital signal for output processing. 

In short: An input activates a row, an output activates a column, a multiplication activates a cell, and an output read takes an ADC conversion.

## Installing
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Accelergy-Project/accelergy-neurosim-plugin.git
cd accelergy-neurosim-plugin
python3 setup.py build_ext && pip install .
```

## Creating Custom Cells
Cell files must follow the NVMExplorer[2]/NVSim[3] format. See the cells/ directory for references. 
PIM crossbars can be created with any user-defined cell.

# PIM Components
We support four components for estimating PIM crossbar energy.

- pim_row_drivers: These activate rows.
- pim_col_drivers: This is the column readout including ADC.
- pim_cell: This is a cell in a crossbar.

## PIM Component Arguments
PIM components take the following arguments.
- technology: The technology node in nm
- row: The number of rows in the crossbar
- cols: The number of columns in the crossbar
- cols_active_at_once: The number of columns to be activated at a single time
- cell_config: The path to a NVMExplorer[2]/NVSim[3] cell file, or a sample cell to use.
- average_input_value: A value between 0 and 1 reflecting the average input being sent on rows. For example, if inputs are encoded as values from 0-4 with an average of 3, average_input_value is 0.75.
- average_cell_value: Like average_input_value, but with encoded weights. For example, if weights are encoded as values from 1-10 with an average of 7, average_cell_value is 0.7.
- sequential: A binary value. If true, rows are addressed and accessed one at a time. Otherwise, rows are to be activated in large blocks and not addressed. Setting this to TRUE can simulate a PIM memory.
- adc_resolution: This is the number of bits of the ADC used for readout. ADC is a flash ADC. To exclude the ADC and use your own, set adc_resolution to 0.
- read_pulse_width: Number of ns each read pulse lasts.
- voltage_dac_bits: Number of bits resolution for a voltage-based DAC on each row. Voltage DACs use a row switch connected to a power rail for each possible input value.
- temporal_dac_bits: Number of bits resolution for a temporal DAC on each row. Temporal DACs enode inputs as an amount of time the row stays high.

# Peripheral Components
We support other digital components from NeuroSim. These components are useful in many places-- not just PIM!
